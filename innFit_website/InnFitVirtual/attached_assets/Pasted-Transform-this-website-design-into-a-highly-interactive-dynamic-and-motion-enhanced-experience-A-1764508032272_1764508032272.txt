Transform this website design into a highly interactive, dynamic, and motion-enhanced experience.

Apply smooth, continuous “swimming” animations across all website elements — as if every component (images, icons, text boxes, cards, and UI blocks) moves naturally on a slow, fluid, train-like motion path. Each element should gently glide, drift, or float using subtle parallax effects, depth layering, and multi-directional motion. The movement must feel organic, soft, and cinematic — never chaotic or distracting.

Interaction Requirements:

Make every button fully clickable with hover micro-interactions (scale-up, glow, soft color shift).

All images should be interactive: tilt on hover, rotate slightly, respond to cursor proximity, and smoothly enlarge on click.

Icons should have playful animations (vibrate, bounce, pulse, or rotate) when hovered.

Cards and text containers should lift upwards with soft shadows when hovered.

Add smooth transitions between sections with layered parallax scrolling.

Include scroll-triggered animations: fade-in, slide-in, staggered content entrance, and floating upward transitions.

Implement physics-based motion (ease-in-out, soft acceleration, deceleration, inertia).

Add a floating cursor effect: images tilt toward the cursor slightly when hovered.

Design Enhancements:

Apply modern 3D depth: shadows, glassmorphism, gradients, and floating layers.

Add interactive hotspots and micro-components that react to user movement.

Make the overall layout feel alive, breathable, and immersive with smooth 3D animations.

Create an elevated modern aesthetic: bold typography, bright color accents, elegant gradients, soft glows, and glossy surfaces.

Responsiveness:

Ensure all animations adapt gracefully to mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Motion paths should scale based on screen size.

Touch interactions should include press, drag, and tap responses.

The final result should feel like an ultra-modern, premium, animated product website with natural "train-like" swimming motion, smooth interactive flows, and delightfully responsive UI elements.
