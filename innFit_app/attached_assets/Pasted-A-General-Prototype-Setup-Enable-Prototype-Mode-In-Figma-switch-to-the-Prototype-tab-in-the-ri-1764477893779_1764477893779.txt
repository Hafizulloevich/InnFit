A. General Prototype Setup
Enable Prototype Mode
In Figma, switch to the “Prototype” tab in the right sidebar to access all interaction and animation settings.
B. Buttons, Icons, and Navigation
Convert Buttons & Icons to Interactive Components
Select each button/icon.
In Prototype mode, drag the blue node to the destination frame (e.g. “Login → Home”, “Back Arrow → Previous Screen”).
Set “On Click” (Tap) as the trigger.
For arrows/sideways navigation, use “On Drag” as a trigger for sliding screens.
Micro-Interactions for Feedback
Duplicate each button as a component with the following states:
Default
Hover (color/brightness change, scale-up slightly)
Pressed (darker or with a ripple overlay)
Use “While Hovering” and “While Pressed” triggers to switch between states (Component → Variants → Add Interactions).
C. Page Transitions & Motion
Smooth Animated Transitions
For all navigational links, set Smart Animate as the animation type.
For panel or page sliders, use “Move In” or “Push” transitions from the relevant direction (left/right/up).
Adjust easing to “Ease In and Out” and set duration to 300–500ms for mobile-like feel.
D. Text Inputs, Search Boxes, & Focus
Build Interactive Text Fields
Create each text input as a Component with these Variants:
Idle (grey/normal)
Focused (blue outline, blinking cursor line)
Filled (shows sample text)
Add interaction: “On Click → Change to: Focused”; “On Click outside → Change to: Filled” (simulate user typing).
For search fields, follow the same approach. Add a magnifier icon that triggers a filter/search overlay or dummy dropdown.
E. Carousels, Cards, and Toggles
Image Carousels (for apparel, galleries, etc.)
Frame all images in a horizontal list.
Add right/left arrow overlays; in Prototype mode, link arrows to next/prev image frames using “On Click” or “On Drag”.
For “swipe” effect, use “On Drag” (left/right), and set Smart Animate transitions between carousel frames.
Product Cards & Tap-To-Expand
For each product/apparel card:
Make a copy for “expanded” view with more details/bigger preview.
Set “On Click → Swap with Expanded View frame (Smart Animate, scale/fade in).”
Toggles/Dropdowns/Segmented Controls
Components with “On Click” to toggle between On/Off or Show/Hide.
Dropdowns: “On Click → Show Dropdown frame as Overlay”.
F. Apparel Selection + Try-On
Apparel Item Buttons
When a user taps any apparel option:
Link this to a version of the avatar/frame updated with the selected item (can use overlays for a smooth try-on effect).
Set transition to Smart Animate for smooth appearance.
G. Scanning Page – 3D Model Integration
Scan Button → 3D Preview Experience
Place a rectangle/container in your “Scanning Page” to represent the 3D viewport.
Create an “Inactive” and an “Active” state:
Inactive: Hide/blur the 3D area.
Active: On “Scan” button click, reveal the preview with a fade-in + scale animation.
Figma Limitation: You cannot embed live 3D, but you CAN:
Use a fake 3D preview image for simulation.
Add an “Open Link” action on the 3D placeholder or a floating button, linking to
Live Sketchfab Model
(Optional) Create several rotated 3D image snapshots and animate between them using On Drag for a “fake turntable” effect.
Add text: “Touch and drag to rotate. (Live 3D opens in browser)”
H. Gestures & Microinteractions
Gesture Hotspots
For any panel/screen where swiping should work:
Drag Prototype links from edge areas and set “On Drag” → next/previous frame.
Use overlays for slide-up/slide-down panels.
Input Feedback & Ripple Effect
For Android-like ripple on tap:
Overlay a semi-transparent circle/gradient and animate it on “While Pressed” (if using figma plugins or manual animation frames).
I. Error, Modal, and Overlay Handling
Popups, Toasts, Modals
Create overlays for these elements.
“On Click” from trigger → Show Overlay frame (with fade/scale animation).
J. Prototyping Summary & Flow Validation
Validate and Tidy Up
Double-check every button, hotspot, and swipe action has a linked prototype flow.
Run “Present” in Figma to simulate the app and test all flows.
Add numbered comments or labels to each major flow for team reference.                                                               This is the workflow of how you should improve my app design. Now, I will start inputting my app screen by screen and give short instructions to build a prototype
